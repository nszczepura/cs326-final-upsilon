## Innovative Idea

Our goal is to make advanced performance tracking for active asset traders more accessible. Users will be able to connect to an exchange api (for the scope project we will focus on a single exchange) to automatically pull and process their past trades so they can more easily identify their strengths and weaknesses i.e. their edge. Similar applications to this exist, but many are clunky and expensive. One popular app is edgewonk. However, edgwonk is used on the desktop and costs around $200, blocking out potential users with smaller accounts.

## Important Components

Automated trade input - Many existing applications require manual input of past trades, we want to be able to connect to an exchange api to quickly and easily pull hundreds or thousands of past trades

Performance metrics - We will generate various performance metrics based on the trade data, things likes profit/loss, average time spent in trade, average profit, average loss, W/L long positions, W/L short positions

Portfolio vs Reference - We want to chart the users portfolio performance against market indices and/or given growth objectives
